# Notification creation requires the configured operation authority

Configured recipient/method/options; watched-content recipients retain implemented read filtering.

## Entry availability

Where this operation enters through user setup, the disabled-board audience is selected as administrators only (effective a_), administrators plus global moderators (a_ or global m_), or administrators plus global/local moderators (a_ or m_ or a local m_). IN_LOGIN/installation/explicit skip paths retain their disabled-board exemptions. Exceeded Load limit excludes ordinary requests while administrative/global/local moderation authority and IN_LOGIN/IN_ADMIN keep the implemented exceptions. These entry checks do not undo an effect already persisted later in the request.
