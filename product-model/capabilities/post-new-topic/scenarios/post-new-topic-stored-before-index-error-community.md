# Post new topic — stored before index error in community

## Trigger

A selected uploaded file accompanies this accepted input. Accepted storage commits, consumes a loaded draft, then the configured search module cannot load.

## Outcome

The stored contribution and synchronized summaries remain, the loaded owner draft is removed, and NO_SUCH_SEARCH_MODULE occurs after persistence.

## Edge cases

- Search-module failure precedes the later watch-choice/read-tracking and notification dispatch branches; those later branches are not reached for this failed run.
